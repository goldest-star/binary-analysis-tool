IMPORTANT: While all the code in hobbits is released under the MIT License
(set out below), some capabilities require FFTW3. FFTW3 is available
under two licenses, the free GPL and a non-free license that allows it to be
used in proprietary programs.

If you distribute FFTW3-enabled hobbits with the GPLed FFTW3 library, your code
must also be GPL licensed. If you do not wish to comply with the terms of the
GPL, you have to buy a FFTW3 license from the copyright holder, MIT. See
http://www.fftw.org/doc/License-and-Copyright.html for more information.
